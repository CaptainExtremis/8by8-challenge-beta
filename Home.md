# Introduction

## What is 8by8?
8by8 is a nonprofit organization originally dedicated to spreading awareness for Asian-American hate, though we have now shifted more toward voter awareness and registration in an effort to reach more of the American public. This is the wiki, on the other hand, is meant to document the 8by8 Challenge. It is meant to increase voter participation across the USA by inviting friends to register to vote to gain access to a special badge for the challenge as well as tangible rewards.
## The purpose of this wiki
This wiki is meant to be a high-level overview of the 8by8 Challenge, serving as an introductory guide to setting up and running the project in a local environment. In English, this is a crash-course on setting up and running the project locally so that you can contribute, if you want to.
## What you should know
This wiki will assume you are familiar with basic programming concepts (Algorithms, OOP, creating functions/classes, etc.). We will attempt to explain and clarify any proprietary terms or concepts used specifically in this project, however a basic level of programming knowledge is required in order to make the most of this wiki. You should also be familiar with "the modern web development stack,"
